Resources: I referred back to notes from COM6638 (Adv. Web 1) to review the appendChild functions for parts ii, iii, and iv. I used this week's lecture to complete parts i and v.

Issues: I was fairly confused with this assignment at first. I tried to complete it using my just my written notes from this week's lecture videos and reviewing my notes from COM6638. Finally after not being able to figure it out perfectly, I rewatched sections of the Thursday's live lecture to fill in the gaps. The only thing that still stumps me a little bit is that when I click on the first box, and then the second box, and then the third box, without hitting the "Start Over" button in between them - all 3 appendChild nodes stay on the screen. I am not sure if the assignment parameters wanted them to disappear if another box was clicked before the start over button. But overall I am glad I figured it out for the most part!
